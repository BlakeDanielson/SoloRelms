- **Faction Relationships**: Allied, friendly, neutral, unfriendly, hostile
- **World Event Consequences**: Economic, political, military, social impacts

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Player Action Processing

```
Player Input: "I draw my bow and scan the forest for signs of the goblins"
‚Üì
Backend loads: Character + Story Arc + World State
‚Üì
AI Service builds comprehensive prompt (4,000 tokens)
‚Üì
OpenAI API call with complete D&D context
‚Üì
Response parsed for combat detection
‚Üì
Game state updated
‚Üì
Rich response sent to frontend
```

### 2. Complete Prompt Structure

```
1. Base D&D Instructions (500 tokens)
2. Complete D&D 5e Rules Reference (1,500 tokens)
3. Character Profile & Analysis (800 tokens)
4. Story & World Context (600 tokens)
5. Environmental Assessment (300 tokens)
6. Game Mechanics Analysis (200 tokens)
7. Response Format Instructions (100 tokens)
```

### 3. AI Response Features

The AI now provides:
- **Vivid Descriptions**: Rich, immersive narrative
- **Mechanical Awareness**: Appropriate ability checks and DCs
- **Equipment Integration**: Uses character's actual gear
- **Tactical Opportunities**: Leverages character strengths
- **Combat Initiation**: Proper combat detection and setup
- **Character Growth**: XP and development opportunities

## üéÆ Example Interaction

**Player Action**: "I draw my bow and scan the forest for signs of the goblins"

**AI Response** (with our system):
> You smoothly draw your longbow, the familiar weight reassuring in your hands. The forest around you is dense with towering oaks and thick undergrowth, perfect for an ambush‚Äîbut also ideal for a skilled ranger like yourself.
>
> As you scan the area, your keen eyes (Wisdom 15, +2 modifier) immediately notice several disturbing signs: broken branches at goblin height, crude footprints in the soft earth, and the acrid smell of their cooking fires drifting from the north.
>
> **Perception Check Suggested**: Roll 1d20+2 to determine how much detail you can discern about the goblin activity.
>
> The wind is picking up, which would give you disadvantage on ranged attacks but also mask any sounds you might make. Your leather armor allows for silent movement, and the dense undergrowth provides excellent cover for stealth approaches.
>
> **Combat Readiness**: With your longbow ready and 30 arrows, you're well-equipped for ranged engagement. Your AC 15 can handle some hits if needed.
>
> What's your approach? Will you attempt a Stealth check (Dex +3) to move closer undetected, make a Survival check (Wis +2) to track their exact numbers, or take a more direct approach?

## üöÄ Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration

```python
# In backend/api/games.py
@router.post("/{game_id}/action")
async def handle_player_action(game_id: int, action: PlayerActionRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Load complete game context
    character = get_character(db, action.character_id)
    story_arc = get_story_arc(db, game_id)
    world_state = get_world_state(db, game_id)
    
    # Build comprehensive AI prompt
    story_template = StoryNarrationTemplate()
    prompt = story_template.build_prompt(
        character=character,
        story_arc=story_arc,
        world_state=world_state,
        player_action=action.action,
        additional_context=action.context
    )
    
    # Generate AI response with full context
    ai_response = ai_service.generate_response(prompt)
    
    # Parse for combat detection
    combat_detected = response_parser.detect_combat(ai_response['content'])
    
    # Update game state and return enriched response
    return {
        'narrative': ai_response['content'],
        'combat_detected': combat_detected,
        'character_status': character.to_dict(),
        'world_updates': world_state.to_dict()
    }
```

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
// In frontend/src/components/game/ImmersiveDnDInterface.tsx
const handlePlayerAction = async (action: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/games/${gameId}/action`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      character_id: characterId,
      action: action,
      context: additionalContext
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  // Display rich AI narrative
  setGameNarrative(result.narrative);
  
  // Show combat indicators if detected
  if (result.combat_detected) {
    setCombatMode(true);
    setShowCombatUI(true);
  }
  
  // Update character and world state
  updateCharacterStatus(result.character_status);
  updateWorldState(result.world_updates);
};
```
