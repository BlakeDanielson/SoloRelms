      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and CI/CD",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup and CI/CD configuration into specific subtasks covering monorepo structure, frontend setup, backend setup, CI/CD pipeline configuration, and testing/linting setup.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a monorepo with Next.js and FastAPI requires significant configuration work across multiple platforms (GitHub, Vercel, Fly.io/Render). The CI/CD pipeline adds complexity, as does coordinating frontend and backend deployments."

      "taskTitle": "Design and Implement Database Schema",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the database schema implementation into subtasks for each major entity (Characters, WorldState, StoryArcs, EnemyTemplates), including table design, relationships, and ORM integration.",
      "reasoning": "Database schema design requires careful planning of relationships between multiple complex entities. SQLAlchemy ORM integration adds technical complexity, and the game state tracking requires thoughtful data modeling."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication implementation into subtasks covering Clerk integration in Next.js, backend user ID storage and association, and protected route configuration.",
      "reasoning": "While Clerk simplifies authentication, integrating it across both frontend and backend requires careful coordination. Session management and user ID association with game characters adds moderate complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Build Character Creation Flow",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the character creation flow into subtasks for UI form development, stat generation backend, race/class selection logic, and character persistence to database.",
      "reasoning": "Character creation involves complex UI forms, backend validation logic, and database operations. The preview functionality and stat rolling mechanics add significant complexity to both frontend and backend implementation."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the story state machine into subtasks for state transition logic, decision tracking, story progression endpoints, database persistence, and NPC status management.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a state machine for story progression is inherently complex, requiring careful tracking of multiple interrelated states. The various story stages and decision tracking add significant complexity to the backend logic."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the AI DM system into subtasks for dice roll mechanics, combat resolution logic, GPT-4o prompt formatting, Redis state management, response parsing, and integration with story state.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines complex game mechanics (dice, combat) with AI integration and state management. The structured prompting for GPT-4o and Redis integration for state tracking make this one of the most technically challenging components."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the game UI development into subtasks for chat interface implementation, scene/image display components, user input handling, and real-time updates from backend.",
      "reasoning": "Creating an interactive text-based UI with image support requires moderate complexity. The chat-like interface and handling various user inputs add to the implementation challenge."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the combat and inventory UI into subtasks for combat HUD component development, inventory panel implementation, backend API integration, and real-time state updates.",
      "reasoning": "Combat HUD and inventory management involve complex UI components with real-time updates. The interaction between these components and the backend state adds significant complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Redis integration into subtasks for configuration and setup, combat state storage/retrieval implementation, and cache invalidation/cleanup mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Redis integration requires specific technical knowledge and careful implementation of caching strategies. The combat state tracking and cleanup mechanisms add moderate complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide testing and refinement into subtasks for automated test development, manual testing scenarios, user feedback collection, UI refinement, and backend/AI prompt optimization.",
      "reasoning": "End-to-end testing of a complex game system with multiple interconnected components is highly challenging. The iterative refinement process based on testing and feedback requires significant coordination across all system aspects."

      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to multiple technical requirements including state machine implementation, turn-based mechanics, complex calculations, and multiple library integrations (XState, immer, seedrandom). The combat logic requires implementing D&D 5e rules with deterministic outcomes while maintaining performance. The comprehensive test strategy adds additional complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI animations using multiple animation libraries (Framer Motion, react-spring, GSAP) and performance considerations for rendering many visual elements simultaneously. The integration of 3D dice rolling, particle effects, and virtualized combat logs adds significant complexity. The visual regression testing requirements also increase the overall complexity."
