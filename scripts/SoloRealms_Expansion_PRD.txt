SoloRealms Game Platform - Feature Expansion PRD

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
SoloRealms is a text-based D&D RPG platform with Next.js frontend and Python/FastAPI backend. The MVP is complete (100%) with working authentication, character creation, basic game interface, backend infrastructure, and database models. This PRD focuses on expanding the platform from MVP to a complete gaming experience.

- Character Creation: 85% complete (functional with auto-user creation)
- Basic Game Interface: 75% complete (WebSocket communication established)
- Backend Infrastructure: 80% complete (FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL/Neon)
- Database Models: 95% complete (StoryArc, WorldState, Combat models exist)
- Story System: 25% complete (backend models exist, no UI)
- Combat System: 30% complete (UI exists, no real combat logic)
- Adventure Management: 10% complete (no adventure flow)
- Social Features: 0% complete
- Admin Tools: 5% complete

PHASE 1: CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Priority: Critical)
Goal: Complete essential missing pages and basic functionality to create a complete user experience

1. CHARACTER MANAGEMENT EXPANSION
- Character Edit Page (/character/[id]/edit): Allow users to modify character details, ability scores, backstory, and appearance. Include validation and error handling.
- Character Adventures History (/character/[id]/adventures): Display list of all adventures for a character with status indicators, quick resume options, and adventure summaries.
- Character Dashboard Integration: Improve character selection and management workflow.

2. ADVENTURE CREATION & MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
- Adventure Creation Wizard (/adventure/create): Multi-step wizard allowing users to select adventure type (short-form 30min vs campaign), choose character, set story preferences/themes, and generate initial story seed using AI.
- Adventure Details Page (/adventure/[id]): Show adventure overview, metadata, story progress visualization using the 6-stage system, character status, and resume/continue functionality.
- Adventure Management API: Backend endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and managing adventure states.

3. STORY PROGRESSION SYSTEM UI
- Story Stage Visual Components: Create UI to display the 6-stage progression (Intro → Inciting Incident → First Combat → Twist → Final Conflict → Resolution) with progress indicators.
- Story Save/Load Interface: Auto-save functionality for every player action, manual save points, load previous states, and story state visualization.
- Narrative Context Display: Show major decisions history, NPC status tracking, and world state information.

4. ENHANCED GAME FLOW INTEGRATION
- Complete Character Creation → Adventure Selection → Story Progression workflow
- Fix missing page routing (/character/[id]/edit and /character/[id]/adventures currently return 404)
- Improve navigation between character management and adventure interfaces

PHASE 2: ENHANCED GAMEPLAY (Priority: High)
